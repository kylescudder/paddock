# Host session handoff

The user authorized the app, Better Auth sign-in limited to an email allowlist (any signed-in user is an admin), OpenRouter models discovered dynamically in Settings, automatic calendar/Emby updates, and CI/CD/Cloudflare using the host's established pattern. Public hostname: **paddock.thescudders.org**. They explicitly deferred sign-in and integration-key setup until a the host session has the needed permissions; do not ask them to paste keys in chat.

## Implemented

The app imports 2025/2026 artwork and measured overlays, adds Singapore sprint variants, handles reordered rounds and venue changes, serves 4K PNG/hybrid SVG at stable event/session URLs, and provides gallery/viewer/copy-image interactions. Discovery supports both OpenRouter's dedicated image API and legacy image chat models. Protected APIs verify an allowlisted Better Auth session on the server. Administration and inference stay closed until sign-in is configured.

The app needs one persistent `data/` directory (backgrounds, render cache, fonts) and one instance. State is in PostgreSQL: provision the `paddock` database and roles on the host first (`provision-project.py paddock`), as for Office Tracker. Madrid/Sepang backgrounds are pending; selecting an OpenRouter model with automatic filling enabled queues them, or the owner can upload artwork. No paid inference calls were made from Forge.

## Deployment to finish on the host

Forge reaches the host, but its SSH identity was rejected. No Cloudflare DNS/Access, host services, or private host configuration was modified from Forge. Follow [deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md) in a Herman-local session rather than assuming those resources exist.

0. Provision the database first: `python3 /Users/kyle/platform/scripts/provision-project.py paddock` (roles `paddock_owner`/`paddock_runtime`, protected password files under `projects/paddock/`, weekly encrypted backup registration).
1. Read `/Users/kyle/platform/runbook.md`, applicable host instructions, and current Office Tracker conventions. Use existing Colima, `platform-web`, Tunnel and Caddy; no self-hosted Actions runner or exposed Docker socket.
2. Open the reviewed checkout at `/Users/kyle/platform/apps/paddock`. Run `python3 -B deploy/bootstrap-host.py`. It preserves private files and prepares the app-specific receiver, signing key and LaunchAgent.
3. With the host's Cloudflare permissions, create a dedicated Service Auth app/policy/token for `deploy-paddock.thescudders.org`, allowing only `github-paddock-deploy`. Put client credentials in GitHub production secrets without displaying them. Use `scripts/hostname.py` for the exact hook path and public app route, as documented. Preserve other services/DNS.
4. Copy approved Better Auth/Brevo/OpenRouter/Emby values from the host's secret store to private runtime `.env`, with only owner addresses in `AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS`, when permissions are ready. Missing values may remain blank for a public-gallery-only first deployment.
5. Set `DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` only after Access, hook and three production secrets exist. Run Release on main. The host verifies provenance before starting the image; the workflow waits for public `X-Paddock-Revision` to match the commit.
6. Verify the live gallery, owner sign-in and that anonymous requests to the admin APIs are refused. Refresh/select an image model and allowance, generate Madrid/Sepang, then connect Emby and review mappings across both seasons. Paid inference, real sign-in, and real Emby writes were not tested without the host credentials.

The release default `DEPLOY_ENABLED=false` allows image publishing before provisioning. Intended `PADDOCK_BASE_URL`: `https://paddock.thescudders.org`. The production environment permits main only. Registry-only attestation uses the official GitHub toolkit's `skipWrite` option because GitHub's repository attestation API excludes user-owned private repositories; the host verifies the signed bundle directly from GHCR. Secret values never belong in source, images, workflow logs or chat.

The deployer follows Office Tracker's Postgres pattern: pre-deploy `pg_dump`, owner-role migration container, restricted runtime role. Failed health restores the previous image; data and immutable generated backgrounds persist. Include runtime configuration/data in the host's established encrypted backups.
